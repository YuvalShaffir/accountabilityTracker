It is the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network.[2][3][4] It was created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.[5][6] It features questions and answers on certain computer programming topics.[7][8][9] It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer websites such as Experts-Exchange. Stack Overflow was sold to Prosus, a Netherlands-based consumer internet conglomerate, on 2 June 2021 for $1.8 billion.[10]\n The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down similar to Reddit and edit questions', 'https://www.bing.com': 'Bing Bing helps you turn information into action, making it faster and easier to go from searching to doing.

This package was designed to (1) load and process digital audio, (2) segment and find regions of interest, (3) compute acoustic features, and (4) estimate sound pressure levels. This workflow opens the possibility to scan large audio datasets and use powerful machine learning techniques, allowing to measure acoustic properties and identify key patterns in all kinds of soundscapes. Note A new stable release of scikit-maad is now available (v1.4.0) This new release adheres to the guidelines for a more robust, stable, and responsive package, aiming to enhance performance and enable more reproducible scientific research.
